# fermentreaders
During August 2020 laagencia developed the escuela de garage vol. fermentation as a summer lab at Rib in Rotterdam (NL), in collaboration with artist and writer Juan Pablo Pacheco. These are the fermentreaders we read collectively every Tuesday at the escuela as we ingested a variety of ferments made by ourselves.
